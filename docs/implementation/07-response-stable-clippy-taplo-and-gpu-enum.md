# 07 Response: Stable Toolchain, Clippy/Taplo Hygiene, and GPU Engine Enum

This document summarizes the work completed after 06 (Manipulator + Difficulty Overlay) to standardize the toolchain on stable, clean up Clippy warnings, enforce Taplo formatting, and prepare the CLI/service for future GPU engines with clear user-facing behavior.

## Summary

- Moved the repository from nightly to stable toolchain, retaining useful components (clippy, rustfmt) and removing an unused wasm target.
- Cleaned up Clippy warnings across the workspace with minimal, idiomatic changes.
- Ensured Taplo formatting passes for all TOML files according to the existing `taplo.toml`.
- Preserved the CPU-prefixed engine variant naming (important for future GPU parity) and added GPU engine placeholders to both CLI and service.
- Selecting a GPU engine now produces a clear runtime error and exits non-zero, making the current status explicit to users.
- Verified that tests, Clippy, and Taplo checks pass on stable.

## Changes Made

### 1) Toolchain

- Switched to stable toolchain:
  - `channel = "stable"`
  - `components = ["clippy", "rustfmt"]`
- Removed the unused wasm target.
- Verified: `cargo +stable test --locked --workspace` completes successfully.

### 2) Clippy Hygiene

- Converted logging to inline format arguments across crates (miner-service, miner-cli, pow-core).
- Removed redundant locals and redundant field names in responses.
- Fixed doc-list indentation in pow-core for Clippy’s doc lints.
- Removed unused helper/imports in tests that caused warnings.
- Preserved CPU-prefixed CLI variants but silenced `enum_variant_names` locally on the enum, not globally:
  - CLI enum variants: `CpuBaseline`, `CpuFast`, `CpuChainManipulator` retained.
- Verified: `cargo clippy --workspace --all-targets` runs cleanly on stable.

### 3) Taplo Formatting

- Ran `taplo fmt` across workspace TOML files and verified `taplo fmt --check` passes.
- Accepted Taplo-driven reordering/indentation as authoritative per `taplo.toml`.

### 4) GPU Engine Placeholders and UX

- CLI additions:
  - Added `GpuCuda` and `GpuOpencl` as enum variants.
  - Updated CLI help text to list gpu engines and note they are unimplemented.
  - Kept CPU-prefixed variants to maintain forward compatibility with GPU engine naming.
- Service changes:
  - Added `EngineSelection::GpuCuda` and `EngineSelection::GpuOpenCl`.
  - In `run(config)`, selecting a GPU engine logs a clear error and returns `Err(anyhow!(...))`. The CLI then exits with a non-zero code and the descriptive message.
- Example user experience:
  - `--engine gpu-cuda` -> logs “engine 'gpu-cuda' is not implemented yet, use cpu-fast or cpu-baseline” and exits non-zero.
  - `--engine cpu-fast` -> normal operation.

### 5) Tests

- Adjusted tests to remove useless comparisons and unused imports.
- Ensured all tests pass on stable: `cargo +stable test --locked --workspace` is green.

---

## Impact

- The project now builds and tests cleanly on stable Rust with Clippy and Taplo checks, aligning with typical CI constraints.
- CPU engine naming convention is retained, preventing churn when GPU engines land, and keeping UX consistent.
- Users receive explicit, actionable errors when selecting a not-yet-implemented GPU engine, reducing confusion.

---

## Usage Notes

- CLI engine options:
  - Implemented: `cpu-baseline`, `cpu-fast`, `cpu-chain-manipulator`
  - Unimplemented (placeholder): `gpu-cuda`, `gpu-opencl`
- Behavior:
  - Selecting `gpu-cuda` or `gpu-opencl` will return a descriptive runtime error and exit non-zero.
  - Selecting `cpu-fast` (default) or `cpu-baseline` runs as expected.

---

## CI Notes

If not already configured, consider adding or verifying the following steps against the stable toolchain:

- Taplo: `taplo fmt --check`
- Rustfmt: `cargo fmt --all -- --check` (if enforcing Rust formatting)
- Clippy: `cargo clippy --workspace --all-targets -- -D warnings`
- Tests: `cargo test --locked --workspace`

This ensures reproducible formatting, lint hygiene, and test coverage in CI.

---

## Future Work

- Implement GPU engines (CUDA/OpenCL) behind feature flags and add device selection/configuration.
- Add GPU-safe metrics and engine-specific instrumentation.
- Benchmarks and performance monitoring across engine types (CPU vs GPU) with comparable worker/affinity settings.
- Optional: stricter lints and Clippy deny rules in CI for selected crates.

---

## Outcome

- Stable toolchain with Clippy and Taplo passing.
- Clear CLI/service behavior for not-yet-implemented GPU engines.
- Minimal, targeted code hygiene changes that improve maintainability and CI readiness without altering engine semantics.
